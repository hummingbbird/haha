# Welcome to haha contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our haha project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [README.md](https://github.com/hummingbbird/haha#contributors) âœ¨.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Sign off Your Work(DCO)

The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. Here is the full text of the DCO. Contributors must sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a Signed-off-by line to commit messages.

```bash
This is my commit message

Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

See `git help commit`:

```
-s, --signoff
Add Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the commit log
message. The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically
certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same
license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin (see
http://developercertificate.org/ for more information).
```
